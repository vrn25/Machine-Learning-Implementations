    "The objective of the game is to form a group of cards with\n",

    "Initially, the dealer and the player have two cards each. \n",
    "One card of the dealer is faced up and other faced down. If the\n",
    "player already has a sum of 21 (an ace and a 10-card) then it is called a natural and he wins, \n",
    "unless the dealer also has a natural, in which case it is a draw. \n",
    "Otherwise, the player has two options: \n",
    "he either hits (continue to withdraw a card from the deck) \n",
    "or sticks (stop picking cards and let dealer play). \n",
    "The player can also go bust (sum exceeds 21) while hitting, in which case the dealerwins.\n",
